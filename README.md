# About
User and customer management system using Laravel, Breeze and Tailwind. Made with study purposes, so I can better understand:

* Breeze itself.
* Eloquent's Relationships, Migrations and Seeding.
* Routes (using and not using 'Route::resources').
* Authentication/Permissions using AuthServiceProvider's Gate::define.
* Forms.
* Session storage to display messages to the user.
* Tailwind.
